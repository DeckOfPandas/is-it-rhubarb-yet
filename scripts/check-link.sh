# Does a link resolve? Prints the HTTP status after redirects and the final
# address, one line: "200 https://where/it/ended". For checking the source
# links in _data/sources.yml and sources/index.html.
#
# USAGE:  sh scripts/check-link.sh https://example.org/page
#
# Sends no credential, writes no file (the body goes to /dev/null), follows
# redirects over https only, gives up after 30 seconds, and sends a browser's
# user agent because several sources refuse curl's own. REFUSES anything but
# one https:// URL of plain URL characters, with no `..` and no `@`: a bare
# `curl -o <path>` writes anywhere, so no allow rule for curl itself could be
# narrow, which is why this wrapper exists and .claude/settings.json allows it.
